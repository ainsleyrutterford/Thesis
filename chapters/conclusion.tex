% \noindent
% The concluding chapter of a dissertation is often underutilised because it 
% is too often left too close to the deadline: it is important to allocation
% enough attention.  Ideally, the chapter will consist of three parts:

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item (Re)summarise the main contributions and achievements, in essence
%       summing up the content.
% \item Clearly state the current project status (e.g., ``X is working, Y 
%       is not'') and evaluate what has been achieved with respect to the 
%       initial aims and objectives (e.g., ``I completed aim X outlined 
%       previously, the evidence for this is within Chapter Y'').  There 
%       is no problem including aims which were not completed, but it is 
%       important to evaluate and/or justify why this is the case.
% \item Outline any open problems or future plans.  Rather than treat this
%       only as an exercise in what you {\em could} have done given more 
%       time, try to focus on any unexplored options or interesting outcomes
%       (e.g., ``my experiment for X gave counter-intuitive results, this 
%       could be because Y and would form an interesting area for further 
%       study'' or ``users found feature Z of my software difficult to use,
%       which is obvious in hindsight but not during at design stage; to 
%       resolve this, I could clearly apply the technique of Smith [7]'').
% \end{enumerate}

% =============================================================================

% Finally, after the main matter, the back matter is specified.  This is
% typically populated with just the bibliography.  LaTeX deals with these
% in one of two ways, namely
%
% - inline, which roughly means the author specifies entries using the 
%   \bibitem macro and typesets them manually, or
% - using BiBTeX, which means entries are contained in a separate file
%   (which is essentially a databased) then inported; this is the 
%   approach used below, with the databased being dissertation.bib.
%
% Either way, the each entry has a key (or identifier) which can be used
% in the main matter to cite it, e.g., \cite{X}, \cite[Chapter 2}{Y}.
