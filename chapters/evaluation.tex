\section{Comparisons with Existing Techniques}

\section{Future Work}

% {\bf A topic-specific chapter, of roughly $15$ pages} 
% \vspace{1cm} 

% \noindent
% This chapter is intended to evaluate what you did.  The content is highly 
% topic-specific, but for many projects will have flavours of the following:

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item functional  testing, including analysis and explanation of failure 
%       cases,
% \item behavioural testing, often including analysis of any results that 
%       draw some form of conclusion wrt. the aims and objectives,
%       and
% \item evaluation of options and decisions within the project, and/or a
%       comparison with alternatives.
% \end{enumerate}

% \noindent
% This chapter often acts to differentiate project quality: even if the work
% completed is of a high technical quality, critical yet objective evaluation 
% and comparison of the outcomes is crucial.  In essence, the reader wants to
% learn something, so the worst examples amount to simple statements of fact 
% (e.g., ``graph X shows the result is Y''); the best examples are analytical 
% and exploratory (e.g., ``graph X shows the result is Y, which means Z; this 
% contradicts [1], which may be because I use a different assumption'').  As 
% such, both positive {\em and} negative outcomes are valid {\em if} presented 
% in a suitable manner.
