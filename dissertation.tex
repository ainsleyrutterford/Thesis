% The document class supplies options to control rendering of some standard
% features in the result.  The goal is for uniform style, so some attention 
% to detail is *vital* with all fields.  Each field (i.e., text inside the
% curly braces below, so the MEng text inside {MEng} for instance) should 
% take into account the following:
%
% - author name       should be formatted as "FirstName LastName"
%   (not "Initial LastName" for example),
% - supervisor name   should be formatted as "Title FirstName LastName"
%   (where Title is "Dr." or "Prof." for example),
% - degree programme  should be "BSc", "MEng", "MSci", "MSc" or "PhD",
% - dissertation title should be correctly capitalised (plus you can have
%   an optional sub-title if appropriate, or leave this field blank),
% - dissertation type should be formatted as one of the following:
%   * for the MEng degree programme either "enterprise" or "research" to
%     reflect the stream,
%   * for the MSc  degree programme "$X/Y/Z$" for a project deemed to be
%     X%, Y% and Z% of type I, II and III.
% - year              should be formatted as a 4-digit year of submission
%   (so 2014 rather than the accademic year, say 2013/14 say).

% This section simply introduces the structural guidelines.  It can clearly
% be deleted (or commented out) if you use the file as a template for your
% own dissertation: everything following it is in the correct order to use 
% as is.

% \section*{Prelude}
% \thispagestyle{empty}

% A typical dissertation will be structured according to (somewhat) standard 
% sections, described in what follows.  However, it is hard and perhaps even 
% counter-productive to generalise: the goal is {\em not} to be prescriptive, 
% but simply to act as a guideline.  In particular, each page count given is
% important but {\em not} absolute: their aim is simply to highlight that a 
% clear, concise description is better than a rambling alternative that makes
% it hard to separate important content and facts from trivia.

% You can use this document as a \LaTeX-based~\cite{latexbook1,latexbook2} 
% template for your own dissertation by simply deleting extraneous sections
% and content; keep in mind that the associated {\tt Makefile} could be of
% use, in particular because it automatically executes BibTeX to 
% deal with the associated bibliography. Alternatively, you might want to upload the entire zip folder onto Overleaf (online collaborative \LaTeX platform)



% =============================================================================

% This macro creates the standard UoB title page by using information drawn
% from the document class (meaning it is vital you select the correct degree 
% title and so on).

\maketitle

% After the title page (which is a special case in that it is not numbered)
% comes the front matter or preliminaries; this macro signals the start of
% such content, meaning the pages are numbered with Roman numerals.

\frontmatter

% This macro creates the standard UoB declaration; on the printed hard-copy,
% this must be physically signed by the author in the space indicated.

\makedecl

% LaTeX automatically generates a table of contents, plus associated lists 
% of figures, tables and algorithms.  The former is a compulsory part of the
% dissertation, but if you do not require the latter they can be suppressed
% by simply commenting out the associated macro.

\tableofcontents
% \listoffigures
% \listoftables
